This repository doesn't have standalone bug tracker. Please submit issues to
https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues.

This repository has been started as addon to the main one due to maintainer
access issues leading to delayed package fixups/updates, but they have been
resolved. Unstable packages are subject for merging with main repo soon.
